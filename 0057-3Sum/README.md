Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/3sum/

Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

**Notice**  
Elements in a triplet (a,b,c) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a ≤ b ≤ c)

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Example**  
For example, given array S = {-1 0 1 2 -1 -4}, A solution set is:
```
(-1, 0, 1)
(-1, -1, 2)
```
