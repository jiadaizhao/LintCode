# 633. Find the Duplicate Number

Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/find-the-duplicate-number/

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Notice**  

1. You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2. You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
3. Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n^2).
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

**Example**  
Given nums = [5,5,4,3,2,1] return 5  
Given nums = [5,4,4,3,2,1] return 4
