# 484. Swap Two Integers in Array

Difficulty: Easy

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/swap-two-integers-in-array/

Given an array and two indexes, swap the integers on the two indices.

**Example**  
Given [1,2,3,4] and index1 = 2, index2 = 3. The array will change to [1,2,4,3] after swapping. You don't need return anything, just swap the integers in-place.
