**Description**  
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example**  
Example 1:
```
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
```
