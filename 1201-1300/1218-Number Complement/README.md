# 1218. Number Complement

Difficulty: Easy

https://www.lintcode.com/problem/number-complement/description

**Description**  
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
2. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.

**Example**  
Example 1:
```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```
