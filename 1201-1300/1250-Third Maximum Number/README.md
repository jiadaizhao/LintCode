https://www.lintcode.com/problem/third-maximum-number/description

**Description**  
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = [3, 2, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = [1, 2]
Output: 2
Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: num = [2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
```
