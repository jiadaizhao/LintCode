Difficulty: Medium

https://www.lintcode.com/problem/top-k-frequent-elements/description

**Description**  
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

* You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
* Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```
