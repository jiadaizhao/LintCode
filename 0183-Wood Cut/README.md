Difficulty: Hard

http://lintcode.com/en/problem/wood-cut/

Given n pieces of wood with length L[i] (integer array). Cut them into small pieces to guarantee you could have equal or more than k pieces with the same length. What is the longest length you can get from the n pieces of wood? Given L & k, return the maximum length of the small pieces.

**Notice**  
You couldn't cut wood into float length.

If you couldn't get >= k pieces, return 0.

**Example**  
For L=[232, 124, 456], k=7, return 114.
