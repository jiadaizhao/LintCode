Difficulty: Easy

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/guess-number-game/

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

**Example**  
n = 10, I pick 4 (but you don't know)

Return 4. Correct !
