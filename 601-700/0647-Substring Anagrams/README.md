# 647. Substring Anagrams

Difficulty: Easy

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/substring-anagrams/

Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 40,000.

The order of output does not matter.

**Example**  
Given s = "cbaebabacd" p = "abc"

return [0, 6]
```
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```
