http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/knight-shortest-path-ii/

Given a knight in a chessboard n * m (a binary matrix with 0 as empty and 1 as barrier). the knight initialze position is (0, 0) and he wants to reach position (n - 1, m - 1), Knight can only be from left to right. Find the shortest path to the destination position, return the length of the route. Return -1 if knight can not reached.

**Clarification**  

If the knight is at (x, y), he can get to the following positions in one step:
```
(x + 1, y + 2)
(x - 1, y + 2)
(x + 2, y + 1)
(x - 2, y + 1)
```

**Example**  
```
[[0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0]]

Return 3

[[0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0]]

Return -1
```
