Given an array of n integer, and a moving window(size k), move the window at each iteration from the start of the array, find the sum of the element inside the window at each moving.

**Example**  
For array [1,2,7,8,5], moving window size k = 3.  
1 + 2 + 7 = 10  
2 + 7 + 8 = 17  
7 + 8 + 5 = 20  
return [10,17,20]
