http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/course-schedule/

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example**  
Given n = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]  
Return true

Given n = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]  
Return false
