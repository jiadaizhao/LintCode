Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

**Notice**  

You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example**  
Given prices = [4,4,6,1,1,4,2,5], and k = 2, return 6.
