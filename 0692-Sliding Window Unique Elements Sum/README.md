Given an array and a window size that is sliding along the array, find the sum of the count of unique elements in each window.

**Example**  
Given a array nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 3] and k = 3

First window [1, 2, 1], only 2 is unique, count is 1.  
Second window [2, 1, 3], all elements unique, count is 3.  
Third window [1, 3, 3], only 1 is unique, count is 1.  
sum of count = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5

Return 5
