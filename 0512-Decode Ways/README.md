http://lintcode.com/en/problem/decode-ways/

A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
```
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
```
Given an encoded message containing digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

**Example**  
Given encoded message 12, it could be decoded as AB (1 2) or L (12).
The number of ways decoding 12 is 2.
