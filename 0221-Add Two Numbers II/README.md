http://lintcode.com/en/problem/add-two-numbers-ii/

You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in forward order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

**Example**  
Given 6->1->7 + 2->9->5. That is, 617 + 295.

Return 9->1->2. That is, 912.
