# 53. Reverse Words in a String

Difficulty: Easy

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/reverse-words-in-a-string/

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

For example,
Given s = "the sky is blue",
return "blue is sky the".

**Clarification**  
* What constitutes a word?
A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
* Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
* How about multiple spaces between two words?
Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.
