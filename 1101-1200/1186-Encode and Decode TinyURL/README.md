**Description**  
TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://lintcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

**Example 1:**
```
Input："https://lintcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"

Explanation：encode and decode by your own algorithm.
```

**Example 2:**
