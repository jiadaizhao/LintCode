Given a non-overlapping interval list which is sorted by start point.

Insert a new interval into it, make sure the list is still in order and non-overlapping (merge intervals if necessary).

**Example**  
Insert [2, 5] into [[1,2], [5,9]], we get [[1,9]].

Insert [3, 4] into [[1,2], [5,9]], we get [[1,2], [3,4], [5,9]].
