http://lintcode.com/en/problem/surrounded-regions/

Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O''s into 'X''s in that surrounded region.

**Example**  
``` 
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```
After capture all regions surrounded by 'X', the board should be:
```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```
