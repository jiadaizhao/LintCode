# 1711. Minimum Falling Path Sum

Difficulty: Medium

https://www.lintcode.com/problem/minimum-falling-path-sum/description

**Description**  
Given a square array of integers A, we want the minimum sum of a falling path through A.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row, and chooses one element from each row. The next row's choice must be in a column that is different from the previous row's column by at most one.

* 1 <= A.length == A[0].length <= 100
* -100 <= A[i][j] <= 100

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The possible falling paths are:
[1,4,7], [1,4,8], [1,5,7], [1,5,8], [1,5,9]

[2,4,7], [2,4,8], [2,5,7], [2,5,8], [2,5,9], [2,6,8], [2,6,9]

[3,5,7], [3,5,8], [3,5,9], [3,6,8], [3,6,9]

The falling path with the smallest sum is [1,4,7], so the answer is 12.
