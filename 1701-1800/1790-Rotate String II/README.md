https://www.lintcode.com/problem/rotate-string-ii/description

**Description**  
Given a string(Given in the way of char array), a right offset and a left offset, rotate the string by offset in place.(left offest represents the offset of a string to the left,right offest represents the offset of a string to the right,the total offset is calculated from the left offset and the right offset,split two strings at the total offset and swap positions)。

**Example 1:**
```
Input：str ="abcdefg", left = 3, right = 1
Output："cdefgab"
Explanation：The left offset is 3, the right offset is 1, and the total offset is left 2. Therefore, the original string moves to the left and becomes "cdefg"+ "ab".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input：str="abcdefg", left = 0, right = 0
Output："abcdefg"
Explanation：The left offset is 0, the right offset is 0, and the total offset is 0. So the string remains unchanged.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input：str = "abcdefg",left = 1, right = 2
Output："gabcdef"
Explanation：The left offset is 1, the right offset is 2, and the total offset is right 1. Therefore, the original string moves to the left and becomes "g" + "abcdef".
```
