**Description**  
Given an array of integers, your task is to count the number of duplicate array elements. Duplicate is defined as two or more identical elements. For example, in the array[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3],the two twos are one duplicate and so are the three threes.you need return an integer denoting the number of non-unique(duplicate) values in the numbers array.

* The array returned is ordered in the order of the Numbers that satisfy the original array.

Input: nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
Output: [2, 3]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: array = [1, 2, 3]
