**Description**  
Given has an array of sales numbers, what is the index of the smallest index element for which the sums of all elements to the left and to the right are equal. The array may not be reordered.
For example, given the array sales = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],we see that 1+2+3=6ï¼ŒUsing zero based indexing,sales[3] = 4 is the value sought.The index is 3.

* 3 <= n <= 10^5
* 1 <= sales[i] <= 2*10^4,where 0 <= i < n
*  It is guaranteed that a solution always exists

**Example 1:**
```
Input : [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
Output : 3
```
