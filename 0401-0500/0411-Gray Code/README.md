# 411. Gray Code

Difficulty: Medium

http://lintcode.com/en/problem/gray-code/

The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, find the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0 and with cover all 2n integers.

**Notice**  

For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.

[0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.

**Example**  
Given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:
```
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2
```
