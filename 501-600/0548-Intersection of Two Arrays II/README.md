http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

**Notice**  
* Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
* The result can be in any order.

**Example**  
Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2, 2].
