Difficulty: Medium

http://lintcode.com/en/problem/k-closest-numbers-in-sorted-array/

Given a target number, a non-negative integer k and an integer array A sorted in ascending order, find the k closest numbers to target in A, sorted in ascending order by the difference between the number and target. Otherwise, sorted in ascending order by number if the difference is same.

**Example**  
Given A = [1, 2, 3], target = 2 and k = 3, return [2, 1, 3].

Given A = [1, 4, 6, 8], target = 3 and k = 3, return [4, 1, 6].
