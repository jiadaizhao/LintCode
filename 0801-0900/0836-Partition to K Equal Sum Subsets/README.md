Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/partition-to-k-equal-sum-subsets/

Given an array of integers nums and a positive integer k, find whether it's possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

**Notice**  
1. 1 <= k <= len(nums) <= 16.
2. 0 < nums[i] < 10000

**Example**  
```
Input: nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1], k = 4
Output: True
Explanation: It's possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.
```
