# 814. Shortest Path in Undirected Graph

Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/shortest-path-in-undirected-graph/

Give an undirected graph, in which each edge's length is 1, and give two nodes from the graph. We need to find the length of the shortest path between the given two nodes.

**Example**  
Given graph = {1,2,4#2,1,4#3,5#4,1,2#5,3}, and nodeA = 3, nodeB = 5.
```
1------2  3
 \     |  | 
  \    |  |
   \   |  |
    \  |  |
      4   5
```
return 1.
