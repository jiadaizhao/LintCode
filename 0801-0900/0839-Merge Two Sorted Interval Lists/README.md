# 839. Merge Two Sorted Interval Lists

Difficulty: Easy

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/merge-two-sorted-interval-lists/

Merge two sorted (ascending) lists of interval and return it as a new sorted list. The new sorted list should be made by splicing together the intervals of the two lists and sorted in ascending order.

**Notice**  
* The intervals in the given list do not overlap.
* The intervals in different lists may overlap.

**Example**  
Given list1 = [[1,2],[3,4]] and list2 = [[2,3],[5,6]], return [[1,4],[5,6]].
