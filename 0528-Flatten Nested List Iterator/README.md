# 528. Flatten Nested List Iterator

Difficulty: Medium

http://lintcode.com/en/problem/flatten-nested-list-iterator/

Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

**Notice**  

You don't need to implement the remove method.

**Example**  
* Given the list [[1,1],2,[1,1]], By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].

* Given the list [1,[4,[6]]], By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
