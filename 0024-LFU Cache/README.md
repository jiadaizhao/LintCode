http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/lfu-cache/

LFU (Least Frequently Used) is a famous cache eviction algorithm.

For a cache with capacity k, if the cache is full and need to evict a key in it, the key with the lease frequently used will be kicked out.

Implement set and get method for LFU cache.

**Example**  
Given capacity=3
```
set(2,2)
set(1,1)
get(2)
>> 2
get(1)
>> 1
get(2)
>> 2
set(3,3)
set(4,4)
get(3)
>> -1
get(2)
>> 2
get(1)
>> 1
get(4)
>> 4
```
