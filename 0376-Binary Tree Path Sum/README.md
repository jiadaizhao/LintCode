http://lintcode.com/en/problem/binary-tree-path-sum/

Given a binary tree, find all paths that sum of the nodes in the path equals to a given number target.

A valid path is from root node to any of the leaf nodes.

**Example**  
Given a binary tree, and target = 5:
```
     1
    / \
   2   4
  / \
 2   3
```
return
```
[
  [1, 2, 2],
  [1, 4]
]
```
