Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/two-sum-closest-to-target/

Given an array nums of n integers, find two integers in nums such that the sum is closest to a given number, target.

Return the difference between the sum of the two integers and the target.

**Example**  
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 4.

The minimum difference is 1. (4 - (2 + 1) = 1).
