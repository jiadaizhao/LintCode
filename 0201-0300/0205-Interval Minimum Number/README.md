http://lintcode.com/en/problem/interval-minimum-number/

Given an integer array (index from 0 to n-1, where n is the size of this array), and an query list. Each query has two integers [start, end]. For each query, calculate the minimum number between index start and end in the given array, return the result list.

**Notice**  
We suggest you finish problem Segment Tree Build, Segment Tree Query and Segment Tree Modify first.

**Example**  
For array [1,2,7,8,5], and queries [(1,2),(0,4),(2,4)], return [2,1,5]
