# 743. Monotone Increasing Digits

Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/monotone-increasing-digits/

Given a non-negative integer N, find the largest number that is less than or equal to N with monotone increasing digits.

(Recall that an integer has monotone increasing digits if and only if each pair of adjacent digits x and y satisfy x <= y.)

**Notice**  
Note: N is an integer in the range [0, 10^9].

**Example**  
```
Given N = 10, return 9
Given N = 12345, return 12345
Given N = 10000, return 9999
```
