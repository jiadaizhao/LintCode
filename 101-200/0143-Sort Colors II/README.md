# 143. Sort Colors II 

Difficulty: Medium

http://lintcode.com/en/problem/sort-colors-ii/

Given an array of n objects with k different colors (numbered from 1 to k), sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order 1, 2, ... k.

**Notice**  
You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

k <= n

**Example**  
Given colors=[3, 2, 2, 1, 4], k=4, your code should sort colors in-place to [1, 2, 2, 3, 4].
