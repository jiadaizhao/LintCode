Difficulty: Medium

http://lintcode.com/en/problem/lowest-common-ancestor/

Given the root and two nodes in a Binary Tree. Find the lowest common ancestor(LCA) of the two nodes.

The lowest common ancestor is the node with largest depth which is the ancestor of both nodes.

**Notice**  
Assume two nodes are exist in tree.

**Example**  
For the following binary tree:
```
  4
 / \
3   7
   / \
  5   6
```
LCA(3, 5) = 4

LCA(5, 6) = 7

LCA(6, 7) = 7
