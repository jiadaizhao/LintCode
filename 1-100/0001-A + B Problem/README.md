http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/a-b-problem/

Write a function that add two numbers A and B. You should not use + or any arithmetic operators.

```
Notice:
There is no need to read data from standard input stream. Both parameters are given in function aplusb, you job is to calculate the sum and return it.
```

**Clarification**
Are a and b both 32-bit integers?
* Yes.
Can I use bit operation?
* Sure you can.

**Example**  
Given a=1 and b=2 return 3

**Challenge**  
Of course you can just return a + b to get accepted. But Can you challenge not do it like that?
