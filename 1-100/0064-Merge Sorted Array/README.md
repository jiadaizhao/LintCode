# 64. Merge Sorted Array

Difficulty: Easy

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/merge-sorted-array/

Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

**Notice**  
You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.

**Example**  
A = [1, 2, 3, empty, empty], B = [4, 5]

After merge, A will be filled as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
