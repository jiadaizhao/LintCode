Difficulty: Medium

http://lintcode.com/en/problem/balanced-binary-tree/

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

**Example**  
Given binary tree A = {3,9,20,#,#,15,7}, B = {3,#,20,15,7}
```
A)  3            B)    3 
   / \                  \
  9  20                 20
    /  \                / \
   15   7              15  7
```
The binary tree A is a height-balanced binary tree, but B is not.
