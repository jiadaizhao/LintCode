**Clarification**
Do I need to implement KMP Algorithm in a real interview?

Not necessary. When you meet this problem in a real interview, the interviewer may just want to test your basic implementation ability. But make sure your confirm with the interviewer first.

**Example**  
If source = "source" and target = "target", return -1.

If source = "abcdabcdefg" and target = "bcd", return 1.
