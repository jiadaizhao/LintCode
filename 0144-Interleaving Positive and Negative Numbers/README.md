http://lintcode.com/en/problem/interleaving-positive-and-negative-numbers/

Given an array with positive and negative integers. Re-range it to interleaving with positive and negative integers.

**Notice**  
You are not necessary to keep the original order of positive integers or negative integers.

**Example**  
Given [-1, -2, -3, 4, 5, 6], after re-range, it will be [-1, 5, -2, 4, -3, 6] or any other reasonable answer.
