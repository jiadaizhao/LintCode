http://lintcode.com/en/problem/palindrome-partitioning-ii/

Given a string s, cut s into some substrings such that every substring is a palindrome.

Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.

**Example**  
Given s = "aab",

Return 1 since the palindrome partitioning ["aa", "b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
