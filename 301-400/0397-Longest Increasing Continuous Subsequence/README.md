# 397. Longest Increasing Continuous Subsequence

Difficulty: Easy

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/longest-increasing-continuous-subsequence/

Give an integer array，find the longest increasing continuous subsequence in this array.

An increasing continuous subsequence:

* Can be from right to left or from left to right.
* Indices of the integers in the subsequence should be continuous.
**Notice**  

O(n) time and O(1) extra space.

**Example**  
For [5, 4, 2, 1, 3], the LICS is [5, 4, 2, 1], return 4.

For [5, 1, 2, 3, 4], the LICS is [1, 2, 3, 4], return 4.
