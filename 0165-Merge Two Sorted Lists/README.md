Difficulty: Easy

http://lintcode.com/en/problem/merge-two-sorted-lists/

Merge two sorted (ascending) linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. The new sorted list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the two lists and sorted in ascending order.

**Example**  
Given 1->3->8->11->15->null, 2->null , return 1->2->3->8->11->15->null.
