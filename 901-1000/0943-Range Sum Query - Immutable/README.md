# 943. Range Sum Query - Immutable

Difficulty: Easy

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/range-sum-query-immutable/

Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i ≤ j), inclusive.

**Notice**  
* You may assume that the array does not change.
* There are many calls to sumRange function.

**Example**  
```
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
```
