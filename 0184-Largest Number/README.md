http://lintcode.com/en/problem/largest-number/

Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

**Notice**  
The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

**Example**  
Given [1, 20, 23, 4, 8], the largest formed number is 8423201.
