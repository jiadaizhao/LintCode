Check a positive number is a palindrome or not.

A palindrome number is that if you reverse the whole number you will get exactly the same number.

**Notice**  

It's guaranteed the input number is a 32-bit integer, but after reversion, the number may exceed the 32-bit integer.

**Example**  
11, 121, 1, 12321 are palindrome numbers.

23, 32, 1232 are not palindrome numbers.
