Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/search-a-2d-matrix-ii/

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix, return the occurrence of it.

This matrix has the following properties:

* Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
* Integers in each column are sorted from up to bottom.
No duplicate integers in each row or column.

**Example**  
Consider the following matrix:
```
[
  [1, 3, 5, 7],
  [2, 4, 7, 8],
  [3, 5, 9, 10]
]
```
Given target = 3, return 2.
