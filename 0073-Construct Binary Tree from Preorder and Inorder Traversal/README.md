Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

**Notice**  
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

**Example**  
Given in-order [1,2,3] and pre-order [2,1,3], return a tree:
```
  2
 / \
1   3
```
