http://lintcode.com/en/problem/remove-9/

Start from integer 1, remove any integer that contains 9 such as 9, 19, 29...

So now, you will have a new integer sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, ...

Given a positive integer n, you need to return the n-th integer after removing. Note that 1 will be the first integer.

**Notice**  
* n will not exceed 9 x 10^8.

**Example**  
Given n = 9, return 10.
