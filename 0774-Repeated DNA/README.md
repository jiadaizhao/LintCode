# 774. Repeated DNA

Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/repeated-dna/

All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T.  
For example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.  
Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

**Example**  
```
Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",
Return ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].
```
