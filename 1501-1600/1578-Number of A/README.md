**Description**  
Given a string with B*A*C*D* pattern, * means the preceding character can appear 0 or multiple times in the string. Count the number of 'A'.

In order to ensure that the time complexity is less than O(n), the program will repeat 1000 times.

**Example 1:**
```
input: s = "BBAACCDDD"
output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```
input: s = "BBCDD"
output: 0
```

**Example 3:**
```
input: s = "AAA"
output: 3
```
