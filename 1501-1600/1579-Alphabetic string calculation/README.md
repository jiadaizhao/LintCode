**Description**  
In the world of the moon, ordinary people will solve a problem. This problem is a string of English letters, each time you can delete an English letter.
Try to delete at least as many times as possible to make each letter appear differently

Only lowercase letters. The length of the English string will not exceed 100,000

**Example 1:**
```
Input: "aaabbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: Because there are three 'a' numbers and three 'b' numbers, deleting one 'a' or one 'b' can satisfy the meaning of the question.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: "abcd"
Output: 3
Explanation: Because 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' each have one, so you need to delete any three to satisfy the meaning of the question.
```
