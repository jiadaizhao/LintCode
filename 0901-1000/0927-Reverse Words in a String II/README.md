https://www.lintcode.com/problem/reverse-words-in-a-string-ii/description

Given an input character array, reverse the array word by word. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.

The input character array does not contain leading or trailing spaces and the words are always separated by a single space.

**Example**  
Given s = "the sky is blue",  
after reversing : "blue is sky the"

**Challenge**  
Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?
